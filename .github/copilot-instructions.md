## Development Environment

For detailed setup and development instructions, please refer to our [Development Guide](../docs/how-to-develop.md).

### User Interaction

Consider the following when communicating with the staff.

- The staff is not technical. Explain in simple terms as much as possible and avoid software jargon.
- Any new code must be easy to maintain and understand, without significant coding experience.

### Program architecture

- The website users are the students and teachers. Make sure the user experience is simple.
- Do not make additional apps or services.
- Do not make command line tools.
- Do not create a long single file application. Always use an easy-to-understand directory structure.
- Only use HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. No other languages.

 ### Security considerations

- Personal information might be processed so privacy and security are important.
- Do not provide examples that encourage the user to hardcode secrets, passwords, or other sensitive information.
- If credentials or other sensitive information is required, add features to the program to prompt for it, store it locally, and logout. For example a login dialog box.
